# Creating Documentation for Your Bubble App

Documentation is essential for helping users understand how to use your Bubble application. This guide will show you how to create comprehensive documentation for your app.

## Why Document Your Bubble App?

Good documentation helps:
- **Onboard new users** quickly and efficiently
- **Reduce support requests** by answering common questions
- **Showcase features** users might otherwise miss
- **Demonstrate professionalism** to potential clients or investors

## Getting Started

### Setting Up a Documentation Structure

First, plan your documentation structure:

1. **User Guide** - How to use the application
2. **Admin Guide** - How to manage the application (if applicable)
3. **FAQ** - Common questions and answers
4. **Troubleshooting** - Solutions to common problems

### Choosing a Documentation Format

You can document your Bubble app in several ways:

- **Within Bubble** - Create a dedicated documentation page in your app
- **External Documentation** - Use platforms like Docusaurus, GitBook, or Notion
- **Video Tutorials** - Record screen captures with voiceover explanations

## Documentation Best Practices

### Use Screenshots Liberally

Bubble's visual interface makes screenshots particularly helpful:

```

### Document Workflows Step by Step

Break down complex processes into numbered steps:

1. Navigate to the Data tab
2. Click "Create a new data type"
3. Enter the name for your data type
4. Add fields by clicking "Add field"
5. Configure each field's properties

### Include Examples

Show examples of how to accomplish common tasks:

**Example: Creating a User Registration Form**

1. Drag a Group element onto your page
2. Add Input elements for Email and Password
3. Add a Button element
4. Set up a workflow on the button to "Create a new User"
5. Configure the workflow to use the input values

## Keeping Documentation Updated

Bubble applications evolve over time. Set a regular schedule to review and update your documentation as you add features or make changes to your app.

Remember that well-documented applications are more likely to be successfully adopted by users!
